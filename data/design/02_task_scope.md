# Task Scope Definition Process

## Process Overview
- **Process Name**: task_scope_definition
- **Framework**: 5W+H (What, Why, Who, Where, When, How)

## Process Stages

### 1. Analyze Requirements
- **Inputs**: final_task
- **Outputs**: initial_scope
- **Description**: Analyze the what, why, and who of the task requirements.
- **Parameters**:
  - **What**: Define the task objectives and deliverables.
  - **Why**: Clarify the purpose and alignment with broader goals.
  - **Who**: Identify stakeholders, team members, and beneficiaries.
- **Possible Outcomes**:
  - requirements_clear
  - needs_clarification

### 2. Define Boundaries
- **Inputs**: initial_scope
- **Outputs**: scope_boundaries
- **Description**: Define task boundaries, including when and where it will take place.
- **Parameters**:
  - **Where**: Identify the location (physical or digital) relevant to the task.
  - **When**: Specify timeframes, deadlines, or milestones.
- **Possible Outcomes**:
  - boundaries_defined
  - needs_adjustment

### 3. Resource Assessment
- **Inputs**: scope_boundaries
- **Outputs**: resource_requirements
- **Description**: Assess the resources required and validate feasibility.
- **Parameters**:
  - **How**: Outline methods, tools, or processes required for execution.
- **Possible Outcomes**:
  - resources_identified
  - resource_conflicts

### 4. Scope Validation
- **Inputs**: initial_scope, scope_boundaries, resource_requirements
- **Outputs**: final_scope
- **Description**: Validate the full scope to ensure readiness for execution.
- **Parameters**:
  - **Validation Criteria**:
    - Are the objectives (what) clear?
    - Does it align with the purpose (why)?
    - Are stakeholders (who) accounted for?
    - Is the location (where) finalized?
    - Are timelines (when) reasonable?
    - Are the processes/tools (how) defined?
- **Possible Outcomes**:
  - scope_approved
  - scope_revision_needed
