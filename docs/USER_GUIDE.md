# Elephant Project - User Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the Elephant Project, an AI-assisted problem analysis and task management system. This guide will walk you through using the application to break down complex problems into manageable tasks.

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Application

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the application URL:
   - Local development: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Production (if deployed): [URL provided by your administrator]

2. You will be directed to the main dashboard displaying existing queries and tasks.

### Creating Your First Query

1. From the main dashboard, click the "New Query" button in the top-right corner.
2. Enter your question or problem statement in the input field.
3. Click "Submit" to create the query.
4. The system will guide you through the problem analysis process.

## Understanding the Process

The Elephant Project follows a structured approach to problem-solving:

### 1. Context Gathering

In this phase, the system will:
- Ask you questions to understand the problem context
- Determine if there's enough information to proceed
- Help you refine your query if needed

**What to do:**
- Answer the questions as thoroughly as possible
- Provide any relevant details, constraints, or requirements
- Be specific about what you're trying to achieve

### 2. Task Formulation

Once enough context is gathered, the system will:
- Formulate a clear problem statement
- Display the statement for your review
- Ask for your approval or feedback

**What to do:**
- Review the task formulation carefully
- Confirm if it accurately represents your problem
- Provide feedback if any adjustments are needed

### 3. Problem Analysis

The system analyzes the problem to understand:
- Key requirements
- The ideal final result
- Critical parameters

**What to do:**
- Review the analysis results
- This step happens automatically, so just review the output

### 4. Task Typification

The system categorizes the problem by:
- Complexity level (1-5)
- Estimated time to complete
- Problem type

**What to do:**
- Review the categorization
- This step happens automatically, so just review the output

### 5. Clarification (if needed)

If the system needs more information, it will:
- Ask additional specific questions
- Use your answers to refine the understanding
- Adjust the task if necessary

**What to do:**
- Answer any clarification questions
- Be as specific as possible

### 6. Approach Generation

The system will suggest:
- Possible approaches to solve the problem
- Different strategies or methodologies
- Recommendations based on the problem type

**What to do:**
- Review the suggested approaches
- This step happens automatically, so just review the output

### 7. Task Decomposition

Finally, the system will:
- Break down the task into smaller, manageable subtasks
- Organize them in a logical sequence
- Establish relationships between tasks

**What to do:**
- Review the task breakdown
- Understand the subtasks and their relationships
- Begin working on the tasks in the suggested order

## Working with Tasks

### Task Details View

To view detailed information about a task:

1. From the main dashboard, click on any task in the list
2. The task details page shows:
   - Problem statement
   - Context and analysis
   - Complexity and time estimate
   - Subtasks (if decomposed)

### Understanding Task Status

Tasks progress through different states, indicated by status badges:

- **Context Gathering**: Still collecting information
- **Refinement**: Refining the task description
- **Task Defined**: Problem statement is finalized
- **Scope Defined**: Boundaries and requirements are set
- **Decomposed**: Task is broken down into subtasks

### Working with Subtasks

For tasks that have been decomposed:

1. Subtasks are displayed in the task details view
2. Click on a subtask to see its details
3. Subtasks may be further decomposed into smaller tasks
4. Work through subtasks in the suggested order

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Queries

- Be specific about what you're trying to accomplish
- Include any relevant constraints or requirements
- Mention the context or background of the problem
- Specify the desired outcome or final result

For example:
- ❌ "How to build a website?"
- ✅ "How to build a responsive e-commerce website for a small business selling handmade crafts, with a budget of $2000 and a timeline of 2 months?"

### Providing Useful Context

When answering context questions, include:
- Your goals and objectives
- Constraints (time, budget, resources)
- Technical limitations or requirements
- Prior knowledge or approaches you've tried
- The intended audience or users

### Managing Complex Problems

For very complex problems:
1. Start with a high-level query
2. Let the system break it down into major components
3. Create separate queries for each major component if needed
4. Link related tasks together in your workflow

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem**: Context gathering seems repetitive or circular.  
**Solution**: Provide more specific, detailed answers with concrete examples.

**Problem**: Task decomposition is too broad or too detailed.  
**Solution**: You can create a new query with a more appropriate scope.

**Problem**: The system misunderstood my query.  
**Solution**: Create a new query with clearer wording, or provide feedback during the context gathering phase.

## Getting Help

If you encounter any issues not covered in this guide:
- Check the FAQ section (if available)
- Contact your system administrator
- Reference the technical documentation for deeper understanding

## Glossary

- **Query**: The initial question or problem statement submitted by the user
- **Task**: A formalized representation of the problem to be solved
- **Context**: Background information and details about the problem
- **Subtask**: A smaller, more manageable part of a larger task
- **Decomposition**: The process of breaking down a complex task into subtasks
- **Ideal Final Result (IFR)**: The best possible outcome for the task
