HTTP is used for transferring web pages, while HTTPS adds a layer of security through encryption.\n\n3. **ISPs (Internet Service Providers)**: ISPs are companies that provide individuals and businesses access to the internet. They manage the network infrastructure and serve as the gateway between users and the vast network of the internet.\n\n4. **Internet Security Measures**: These include various technologies and practices designed to protect data and systems from cyber threats. Security measures include encryption, firewalls, VPNs (Virtual Private Networks), and practices like regular software updates and using secure passwords.\n\nUnderstanding these aspects gives a broad overview of how the internet operates, from the physical connections and pathways to the protocols enabling communication and the security measures protecting users and data.",
